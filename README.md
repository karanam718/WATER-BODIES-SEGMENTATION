Water Bodies Segmentation

Water Bodies Segmentation
This project focuses on segmenting water bodies from satellite images using computer vision techniques. The project uses Python libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and possibly deep learning models for accurate segmentation.

Overview
Water bodies segmentation is a crucial task in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. This project demonstrates how to segment water bodies from images using various image processing techniques and, optionally, machine learning models.
